Arroyo
======

Arroyo is an automatic multimedia-multilingual download manager.

How does it work
=============

Arroyo draws the magnet links found in a set of user-defined URLs, analyzing and extracting information from them, and stores them in a database.

Subsequently, based on a set of criteria defined by the user and selects the corresponding links and downloads them.

Arroyo recalled what material has been already downloaded (or it's in process) and is aware of the fact that several links may correspond to a single episode or movie. Thus avoiding down the same content twice. It also allows you to select the quality or language content that you want.

In a way is a cross between brook and Couchpotato SickBeard adding being multilingual and multimedia (in the way it handles episodes, movies, music, books or anything).
