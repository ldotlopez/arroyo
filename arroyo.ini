; Queries
;

; Queries are the way to download sources.
; Using a query you are filtering sources from the database
; and pushing them into downloader.
; See query --help
; [query.label]
; ; Query is a set of one or more filters. There are some examples:
; ; Most filters have "modifiers" like:
; ; "_like": case-insensitive filter using wildcards (*, .)
; ; "_regexp": Use a regular expression
; ; "_in": Comma-separated list of possible values
; ; "_min" and "_max": Used with integer values, the usual suffixes like
; ;                    [KkMmGg] are valid.
